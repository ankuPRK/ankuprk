This documents the event camera simulator we will be using in this project: [ESIM](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_esim).

## Generate SSH Key and Link to Github Account
SSH key must be linked to your Github account to succcessfully install the simulation. Generate your key by folliwng the Github tutorial [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and upload it to your Github account [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

If you already have a SSH key linked to your Github account, you may proceed directly to the **Installation** section. 

## Installation
The installation instructions for the ESIM simulatorm is [here](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_esim/wiki/Installation).

## Test Installation with Planar Renderer
Check if you've successfully installed ESIM by going through the tutorials of [Planar Renderer](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_esim/wiki/Planar-Renderer). Planar Renderer simulates a 3D camera motion in a planar scene (one plane with texture attached to it).

To edit sensor parameters (e.g., camera, IMU), edit the ``` cfg/example.conf ``` file.
